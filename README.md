Developed a Python-based banking system that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. Utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a user-friendly interface and efficient data management for multiple users. The system supports secure transactions and real-time balance updates, showcasing proficiency in Python, data handling, and system design.
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of a Python program that simulates a simple banking system. This program will handle basic functionalities like creating an account, viewing account balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. This can serve as a base for more complex banking applications with additional features.
Outline of the Program
1. Define an Account class: Each bank account will be an instance of this class.
2. Define methods for account actions: Methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance.
3. Define a Bank class: This manages multiple accounts, allowing for account creation and searching.
4. User Interaction: A simple command-line interface to interact with the bank.
